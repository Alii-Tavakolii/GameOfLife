# GameOfLife

## Overview

The "GameOfLife" project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This simulation models the evolution of cells on a grid based on simple rules, leading to complex patterns and behaviors.

## Features

- **Cellular Simulation**: Simulates the life cycle of cells on a grid, including birth, survival, and death.
- **Pattern Generation**: Supports various initial patterns, such as gliders and oscillators.
- **User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the simulation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alii-Tavakolii/GameOfLife.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd GameOfLife
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   # For Python projects
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.*

## Usage

To run the simulation:

```bash
python game_of_life.py
```

*Replace `game_of_life.py` with the main script of your project.*
